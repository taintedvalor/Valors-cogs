# Valors-cogs
a bunch of fucking cogs! 
If you have any questions please [join my discord!](https://discord.gg/QysVtMvgSN)

The table below lists all available cogs, as well as their current state. If a cog is listed as 'not ready' that simply means that I haven't gone through to productionalize / standardize the code. They still work, I just haven't cleaned them up entirely yet. Use at your own risk!
